VALORANT Patch Notes 10.00,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-00,2025-01-07T14:00:00.000Z,10.00,"Happy New Year, gamers! Welcome to Season 2025. It’s Kenny here, and I’m beyond stoked to share the first set of patch notes for the year. Patch 10.00 is now live.
With 10.00, Tejo explodes his way onto the battlefield with guided ballistics and superior swagger. Anybody know where I can get those glasses?
Anyway, Fracture and Lotus are back in the Competitive map pool, the new FLEX cosmetic is in your Collections page, Automatic Remake Voting is here, and The Esports Hub is returning soon for the new VCT season. Oh, and we fixed a few bugs.
If you haven’t seen it, check out the Tejo Agent Reveal Trailer below in the patch notes. GL HF in the new year, everyone!
Raze, Sova, and Gekko’s explosions should behave more consistently in how they deal damage.
Tejo is en route. Our newest Initiator from Colombia will be released in a staggered rollout to all regions starting at 9:00 AM PT on January 8th ."
VALORANT Patch Notes 10.01,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-01,2025-01-21T14:00:00.000Z,10.01,"Hey folks! It’s Ash and I’m excited to be back at it again for another stellar year of VALORANT. One of my New Year’s resolutions is to hit Immortal for the first time…let’s see how that goes. What’s yours?
Patch 10.01 is short but very sweet. Rank Shields have been added to Competitive Mode so when you’re in Tier 1 at 0 RR, you have 3 chances to win before dropping to the next rank below. There are also lots of bug fixes for our newest agent, Tejo.
Happy 2025, y’all. Let’s get it."
VALORANT Patch Notes 10.02,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-02,2025-02-04T14:00:00.000Z,10.02,"Hi there, it’s Ash! Hope everyone’s competitive grind is going strong since the Rank Shields were released.
Small patch this time but with important bug fixes, of course!"

This week’s patch is another small one as we get closer to Masters Bangkok Finals. In it, you’ll find some small updates to minimap clarity, changes to Chamber, Skye, and Harbor’s slow behavior, and a couple bug fixes.
GL HF!
(Due to a Riot holiday and our offices being closed, Patch 10.03 will deploy one day later on 2/19)"
VALORANT Patch Notes 10.04,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-04,2025-03-04T14:00:00.000Z,10.04,"Hey everyone! It’s Ash here. This is a spicy patch so lock in for these notes.
Hailing from Thailand, Waylay is joining the roster as our newest Duelist! We can’t wait to see your gameplay highlights so get ready to post those insane clutches and aces. There’s also major updates to Clove, Deadlock, Iso, and Tejo, and a small VFX change to Neon. Ascent and Icebox are rotating IN, and Abyss and Bind are rotating OUT. And for the Odin enjoyers on Ascent, you might want to rethink your strategy for how you hold B main.
As always, we’re looking at your feedback so please continue to share your thoughts. Happy gaming!
Clove has been overperforming in ranked so we’re making some adjustments to their abilities to keep ranked in a healthy spot. Similar to balance changes we’ve made in the past, we’d like to continue encouraging Controller diversity by making space for other Agents who have similar strengths.
No longer explodes after a 1.3 second timer after casting. Explodes after contact with the ground after a 0.75s timer.
Projectile audio has been updated to fit this new behavior.
Cooldown duration increased from 30s >>> 40s
Health buff duration increased from 8s >>> 10s
Move speed duration reduced from 8s >>> 3s
To account for GravNet swapping to a signature, we’ll be shrinking the size and increasing some of its counterplay. Since the skill will be cast more frequently, we’d like to encourage plays to be more intentional and precise about placement.
Changed to a non-signature ability
Cost: Free >>> 400 credits
Changed to a signature ability with 40s cooldown
Total Size decreased from 16m >>> 13m
Gravnet’s Projectile audio loop has been updated to increase its gameplay clarity.
When an enemy removes the net, the audio cue of the net breaking now plays for all players.
Since his updates in patches 8.11 and 9.0, Iso has been a bit of a one-trick pony around his Double Tap. These changes are intended to redistribute power around Iso’s kit to make him a more well-rounded agent. Changes to Undercut intend to increase his overall strategic options, and Contingency is receiving an alternate cast paradigm to support slower play and its ability to iso late angles.
We’re reverting Iso’s Double Tap tagging change, as trying to kill Iso through his shield is already a highly frustrating and powerful moment.
Changes to Kill Contract are intended to ensure that won duels in the arena always spawn an orb.
Reduced charges from 2 >>> 1
Cost increased from 200 >>> 300 credits
Now applies Suppression alongside Vulnerability for the same duration (4s) on players hit.
This does not affect the duration of Contingency.
Iso now receives a Heavy Penetration tag rather than a Wall Penetration tag when the shield is broken. This means he’s slowed more upon his shield breaking.
BUGFIX: If Iso DOES NOT have Double Tap’s buff applied, the ultimate will now automatically apply it so that won ultimate duels always spawn an orb.
VFX around Neon’s Overdrive have been updated to make Neon and her directionality clearer when she is fighting with Overdrive active.
Since Tejo’s release, we’ve been monitoring the interaction where Tejo can destroy Killjoy’s Lockdown with his Guided Salvo.
But in the case of Tejo’s Guided Salvo cooldown model, both players get into unsatisfying stalemates where neither Tejo nor Killjoy want to be the first person to cast. So we’re changing Guided Salvo so that it requires more teamplay to successfully destroy a Killjoy ultimate. Killjoy’s Lockdown will now survive Guided Salvo with 5 HP.
Damage decreased from 70 >>> 65
Guided Salvo now does 50% damage to non-player objects.
Ascent and Icebox are back IN the COMPETITIVE and DEATHMATCH queues.
Abyss and Bind are OUT of the COMPETITIVE and DEATHMATCH queues.
While bullet penetration is a meaningful system that rewards map knowledge and situational execution, we feel like the weapon spam here at barrier drop is currently creating unhealthy gameplay and frustrating experiences. This change will give Attackers some added safety at barrier drop when first approaching B Main.
Changed part of the B Main wall along B Lane to non-pennable.
Overhauled visuals of the detailed damage breakdown panel to be more organized and intuitive.
Checked in a more systemic fix to an issue where Neon could jiggle her head up and down while sliding if mashing strafing inputs.
Fixed an issue where Fade’s hands got stuck in place if she crouched while holding Nightfall out.
Fixed an issue where the Rank Shield icon on the Match History page would disappear after playing a non-Competitive game.
There is a bug where the first person camera angle may be slightly offset from the expected player point of view while spectating another player.
Generally speaking, we believe that the best version of VAL is true across all platforms. As a result, we only look to make console-specific changes when absolutely necessary. We’d like to take this opportunity to adjust any changes that may no longer be needed. If you’re curious, we approach this problem by taking a look at data and community feedback to evaluate performance on each platform.
We’ve been paying close attention to Neon for a long time on console… After her nerfs in patch 9.11, we looked at her current power-profile and are comfortable in increasing some of her potential.
Head Damage Multiplier increased 2.5 >>> 3.0 (Standardizing to PC)
Body Damage Multiplier: 1.0 (unchanged, already same as PC)
Leg Damage Multiplier increased 0.75 >>> 0.85 (Standardizing to PC)
Fuel Drain Per Second: 0.11 >>> 0.1 (Standardizing to PC)
Yoru often occupies a niche, high-mastery, high-return position in the Agent roster. Yoru’s kit is difficult to master but players can realize significant returns on their time investment. When looking at the data, his power-profile overall was lower than expected for the effort required.
We took a look at your feedback around his kit feeling “clunky” on console, and have looked to remove some of the changes that are both making his kit feel more difficult to execute.
Unequip delay decreased 1.2s >>> 0.8s (Standardizing to PC)
Max flash duration increased 2.0s >>> 3.0s (Standardizing to PC)
Note: We’re keeping the console-specific counterplay added to Yoru’s Fakeout.
Max Flash Duration increased from 1.25s >>> 1.75s (Standardizing to PC)
Flash Explosion Delay: 0.7s >>> 0.6s (Standardizing to PC)
Note: Similar to Yoru’s Decoy Flash, Leer continues to have a slightly longer (+0.2s) activation time and duration. This patch does not change that."

First and foremost, Ranked Rollbacks are here! Check out the notes below for more detail, and keep an eye on our social channels for a short video showing how this change will show up in your game client.
Beyond RR Rollbacks, you’ll also notice some minor Bug Fixes for Agents.
That’s all from me. GL HF GG."
VALORANT Patch Notes 10.06,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-06,2025-04-01T13:00:00.000Z,10.06,"Hey folks, it’s Ash!
For patch 10.06, we’re looking at a nice lil buff for KAY/O that introduces a new mechanic to his flashes causing them to pop earlier upon bouncing. KAY/O’s resurrection time has also gone down by half, so you’ll no longer have to yell at your teammate to watch your back as you res…well you’ll be yelling for half as long at least.
There’s also a bunch of bug fixes. For those of you on console who may have seen that you’re not getting progress at the end of each game—don’t worry, it’s a visual bug and you are still getting your progress!
Lastly, we’re adding 4 extra teleporters on Bind and none of them are connected so entering any of them will shoot you out at 1 of the other 5 locations at random. Please let us know how you feel about it!
Until next time, happy gaming and don’t forget to 1, 2, 3, flash!

This patch brings some Agent balance updates for Brim, Astra, and Yoru, plus the long-awaited Gifting functionality to the Featured Store, and a slew of bug fixes.
Oh, and you might catch a little nostalgia if you listen to the music throughout the game. That Episode 1 menu music really takes me back…
Ok, that’s all from me. GL HF, gamers!
In celebration of VALORANT’s fifth anniversary, we are bringing some of the Episode 1 music back in patches 10.08 and 10.09. This includes music for the menus, character select, and Victory/Defeat."

Hiya, friends. It’s Kenny—here to walk you through Patch 10.09.
Today’s patch has some highly anticipated changes to Tejo, a minor nerf to Breach’s stun, some small updates to starting ultimate points in Swiftplay, and various bug fixes.
Let’s jump into it."
VALORANT Patch Notes 10.10,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-10,2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,10.10,"Hey folks! Ash here with the next round of patch notes.
First and foremost, we have some upcoming changes to the client throughout the year, starting with the Collection for patch 10.10. Our goal is to unify the player interfaces for PC and console which means we can reduce the time spent supporting them separately and focus on delivering cool new things more quickly. Sometimes you’ll see nice QOL changes, and other times you might think they’re negligible–either way, it’ll be better for everyone in the long run!
Separately, we updated Raze’s explosion VFX to her Boom Bot and Paint Shells and for Tejo, his ult, Armageddon, will start at 3 points instead of 2 in Swiftplay (this was already live in patch 10.09 but we missed it in patch notes)!
Other hot news: for players under Radiant, we increased the cap of refunded RR you can receive within an Act. Icebox is still disabled for Deathmatch & Escalation to address issues.
Okay enough chit-chat, hop on."
VALORANT Patch Notes 10.11,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-10-11,2025-06-10T13:00:00.000Z,10.11,"HAPPY 5TH ANNIVERSARY TO VALORANT! Whether you’ve been here since beta or just started recently, we hope you’ve had a fantastic time playing the game and making new memories. It’s Ash here and while my win rate is down, the vibes are up. Let’s talk patch 10.11.
We’ve added a Finisher Cam that will trigger for skinline finishers to help combat visual clutter and Icebox will remain disabled in Deathmatch and Escalation to address some issues.
We heard you like the new anniversary video so the career page menu music has been updated to a remix of Ego by Qing Madi.
And last but certainly not least, it’s time to tell your 5-stack to start grinding again because there’s updates to Premier! In addition to the gun buddy and title, the winners will also receive a lovely new player card effect that’ll certainly instill fear in your enemies when they see it in the loading screen.
Here’s to another 5 years of wins and whiffs!

VALORANT Patch Notes 11.00,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-11-00,2025-06-24T13:00:00.000Z,11.00,"Heya folks! It’s Ash and I’m going to get straight into it because this is a BIG patch. Let’s go!
TLDR;
Agents
Agent abilities adjusted = Waylay, Reyna, Phoenix, Neon
Agent clarity and consistency improvements = Breach, Sova, Clove, Killjoy, Cypher, Omen, Brimstone
Maps
New map = Corrode
New mode = Corrode Only queue in Swiftplay for 5 days (to help you learn the map!)
For Competitive and Deathmatch = Bind and Corrode are in, Pearl and Split are out
For the first 2 weeks of Competitive, Corrode RR losses are reduced by 50%, wins are still 100% (to also help you learn the map!)
Competitive
You may see less of a drop in rank after completing placements for this midseason reset.
The maximum rank you can place is now Ascendant 3 instead of Ascendant 1.
Now there’s other spicy updates, such as the esports hub coming to console, so grab a coffee and jump in below!
As we continue to tune ability strength for consistency, there’s opportunity for a couple of small changes with a few of our Agents so there’s more room for counterplay and opportunities for clutch moments like flicking to turn flashes.
We’re also adjusting Neon’s Relay Bolt and Phoenix’s Curveball to have room for some additional counterplay. These abilities are meant to create strong combat advantages, but their fast activation left little time for opponents to respond. These changes aim to increase moment-to-moment counterplay without removing the need to anticipate and position against them.
These below changes are part of our ongoing effort to improve gameplay consistency & combat clarity similar to our updates to Neon’s Overdrive visual effects and Deadlock’s Barrier Mesh health states.
Welcome to Stage V25A4! Participate in Premier to earn new team recognition!"

Don’t forget to check out your gun buddy collection later today and show off your “Hot New Engine” gun buddy if you’re a fan of cool new tech.

So we wanted to assess Phoenix in a world where Curveball is more competitive with the rest of the ecosystem to get a sense for the impact of the changes. We view Phoenix as an aggressive entry Agent, so the additional Run It Back and Blaze changes are intended to support his proactive intentions when taking space or fights early on into rounds.

Run it Back (X)
We’ve noticed you Yoru players having a bit of friction achieving the dream of setting up a master plan while in ultimate. We’re hoping these changes will reduce a bit of that problem, rewarding you for using your flash during ultimate, while still preventing unhealthy play patterns that leave enemies without counterplay.

We're updating the ultimates for the following Agent so that they follow similar regional damage rules to our weapons—where hitting the head and legs of an enemy applies different damage multipliers. Intent is to reward precision and create intuitive consistency across damage in VALORANT.
For Neon specifically, it also gives us more tuning levers for balancing her across different skill levels. This change should also add depth to the mastery needed when tracking while sprinting that her ult demands.

We’re in a more stable state since Champions, and Game Changers teams will have decent time to acclimate before the Game Changers World Championships takes place.
When it comes to Duelists with a flash ability, many of them have been outclassed by some of our Initiators when it comes to generating kills for themselves off their flashes. Skye and KAY/O are often better at taking aggressive 1v1s than Agents that we expect to be able to thrive in those scenarios like Yoru, Phoenix, or Reyna.
These changes are intended to increase the total teamplay output of Skye and KAY/O when they coordinate plays with their teammates, and decrease some of their efficacy when played alone. We also hope to increase the reward for putting more time into mastering their flash abilities. We believe that Initiators should still be able to make solo plays, but they should ideally be weaker than their Duelist counterparts in these scenarios. —Dan “penguin” Hardison, Designer
Guiding Light’s destructibility didn’t feel like meaningful counterplay, instead overtly punishing when Skye tried to throw them at a longer range. By increasing the top-end output and rewarding Skye for bending her birds into the right spots, we intend to foster more teamwork and differentiate her Guiding Light from other flashes in the game—especially when compared to Duelists.
KAY/O’s underhanded FLASH/DRIVE (right-click) has been overperforming relative to other “pop” flashes (example, Phoenix's flash or Yoru’s flash). And we feel as though labbed out left-click overhand throws aren’t generating a powerful enough reward for the mastery required to get them to pop in the right place. This tuning weakens the right-click when compared to pop flashes from Duelists, with the belief that KAY/O should pay a cost for his versatility.
Reyna’s flash underperforms as a selfish entry-tool, especially at higher skill levels. This set of changes is intended to give Reyna more agency around how she decides to peek after casting Leer. Also, it should sharpen Leer as a powerful angle-breaking tool against Operators on maps with longer sightlines. We’ve also felt like individual casts of the eye remain in the world for too long when the eye isn’t destroyed. If Reyna is now able to make more selfish plays off her Leer, we then wanted to reduce some of the value it has when thrown for teammates.
Yoru is a tricky agent, as we need to balance him around his capability to throw flashes during his ultimate. We opted to go with a simple duration increase for Blindside as we feel maintaining the turning counterplay around his flash and clone is important to avoid excessively frustrating situations.
Fracture is receiving quite a few quality of life changes alongside some larger updates to Dish/A Drop and A Ropes. Going to go in the order of minor to major changes.

Below are features that we’ve wanted to make for a while just as much as you’ve wanted them. We’ll admit, there’s still so much more that we can do, like inclusion of additional filtering options, a search function, expansion of the random feature to other content types, and more. The team wants it and are working on it—but we didn’t want to wait until every possible option was covered for us to release the changes here. Better a version of something than not having it at all.
This team shares the same belief as the rest of VALORANT: that the value of a “live service” game means we can develop with you and improve over time. It does mean that sometimes new stuff may seem bare bones as we vet a feature’s value, incrementally. As we push forward with both Favorites, Filters, and Randomizer (along with other QoL) we’re taking this step by step approach.

VALORANT Patch Notes 5.10,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-5-10/,2022-11-15T14:00:00.000Z,5.10,"We’re back with Patch Notes 5.10 and we’re addressing some of the larger issues players have had with Cypher and Fade in the past. Also included are a bunch of Agent bug fixes and a new feature called Real Time Text Evaluation so that players can feel safer engaging with their teammates and opponents. Read more about it below.
As the game has evolved, we’ve seen Cypher’s presence and relative impact on the roster fall off. While we attribute part of this to Chamber coming to dominate the Sentinel slot more than we think is healthy, we also have found that overtime Cypher’s Trapwire setups have become too predictable and easy to counter and that his Ultimate has felt lacking both in restrictions required to pull it off and the reward for doing so. The increase in Trapwire distance should open up a lot of new potential setups for Cypher and allow him to mix up his play patterns in a way that forces his enemies to slow down and move carefully through the map if they want to spot them without being caught.
Removing the time restriction on enemy corpses should make his Ultimate more accessible than it has been in the past and allow for Cypher to feel more agency when he initiates Neural Theft, while adding a second ping should create a clearer period of time where Cypher is pulling the strings, taking in the information on the enemies initial location and setting up strategic moves based on the pressure of the second. We hope that these updates get Cypher mains out there coming up with new setups for their information webs and that, when paired with upcoming updates to Chamber, help him reclaim a compelling spot amongst his peers.
Fade's Prowlers have been a versatile and difficult-to-play-against ability that we're looking to sharpen with these changes. The duration changes encourage Fade to be more deliberate in the areas that she chooses to sweep, while the other tweaks to the ability are meant to help enemies on the counterplay side of things.
The Nightfall cost is increasing in price, as we've found the baseline value of the Ultimate to be on the higher end compared to other Ultimates in the game.
Harbor abilities all make a healthy round impact, but we saw some players new to Harbor not using their abilities enough and feeling too constrained. We hope these changes make it easier for players to hit the ground running with Harbor and for skilled Harbor players to achieve more flexibility when controlling the map."
VALORANT Patch Notes 5.12,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-5-12/,2022-12-06T14:00:00.000Z,5.12,"Last patch before the end of the year—and it’ll be a long one (last until Patch 6.0 goes live in January). Check out what we’ve got going on in Patch 5.12 below.
With pro play heading into the offseason after the completion of an amazing Game Changers Championship, we’re taking the opportunity to hit some broad updates we’ve been looking to make along with individual Agent changes.
We've increased the point costs of the Agent Ultimates that have large, site-wide footprints. These changes should reduce their overall frequency and increase counterplay against them at the strategic level.
In addition to the Ult adjustments, we've also made a tuning pass on Agent ability economy. The areas targeted in this pass include: Total loadout cost outliers (for their respective role), Agents with lack of pistol round buy options, and unintended power relative to the cost of the ability.
To wrap up the broad updates, we’ve taken a pass at the HP of destructible objects in the game. Damage-over-time area abilities (like Brimstone’s Incindiary and Viper’s Snakebite) now damage enemy utility ( read more in the Gameplay Systems Updates ), so we’ve increased the health of 1hp destructibles so that they aren’t instantly vaporized—but can still be destroyed by one-shot in most situations. Also, Killjoy’s Lockdown gets a bigger health bump to reduce the number of abilities that can destroy it solo. Boombot and Prowlers on the other hand have felt like they require unloading too many bullets given their other strengths, so the health of those abilities have been reduced.
We're back again with small Harbor buffs. It is hard to learn a new Controller smoke style and we hope these changes make it easier for Harbor's vision block to last long enough to finish executing with their team, while also providing wall smoke duration that’s on par with Viper. We’ll continue to monitor Harbor’s strength and see if we need to make any more waves. Chalo!
We’re looking to slightly refine Sage's strengths to be more about fortifying areas she controls and helping allies, rather than offense-focused with her utility. We’re hoping the heal update will push her power and satisfaction when fully healing others while creating tradeoffs for playing Sage overly aggressive and relying on self-healing.
We’re reeling in Viper’s ability to play outside of her ultimate’s smoke area. These changes will anchor Viper more to her ultimate and allow coordinated retakes against Viper’s Pit to be more successful.
Assist tails are the “grace period” duration after a debuff has expired where a player will still be awarded an assist for debuffing the killed target.
With damage-over-time area abilities now universally damaging utility, we took a pass on damage multipliers. These area damage abilities cover a wide space and deal large amounts of damage over their duration. We’ve reduced their non-player output to 50% of base damage to prevent instant destruction of enemy utility and to ensure abilities with higher health, such as Sage Barrier Orb, retain their relevant impact.
The following abilities are now immune to allied damage.
We felt the Spectre was overperforming at mid to long ranges and, as a result, was crowding out other options on partial buys.

Happy New Year, y’all—we’re starting off 2023 with Patch 6.0.

The Gameplay Systems change should be subtle but it’s intended to minimize the impact another player’s networking conditions have on your game.
When a player fires a shot, it takes time for the input to reach the server. To prevent you from needing to lead your shots, VALORANT implements server rewinding. When the server determines the outcome of a shot, it rewinds character positions around the bullet to match their locations at the time when the shot was initially fired. Finding the right limit for a max rewind amount is important for reducing cases of anyone feeling like they need to lead shots, or that they can still be shot after safely repositioning themselves.
When we launched the game, the max rewind value was set to 200 ms based on what we deemed as acceptable networking conditions (factoring in some amount of additional input/processing latency) to play VALORANT. Based on player data since launch, we’ve determined that this value is too high for the networking conditions experienced by most of you. —Kevin Lee, Software Engineer
We feel that the Stinger is overperforming at medium to long range engagements at its price point. Force buying Heavy Armor and Stingers on both round 2 and 3 was too effective and lacked the appropriate nuance and economic tradeoffs. We hope that players can occasionally still access this strategy granted they have the credits to do so."
VALORANT Patch Notes 6.03,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-6-03/,2023-02-14T14:00:00.000Z,6.03,"Hello! Jo-Ellen here. Thank you for all your feedback on Swiftplay. We’re happy to hear how much you love this mode. Additionally, we’ve got a Killjoy and Raze update—and even more bug fixes.
With Chamber’s recent balance and the increased reliability of Killjoy’s Lockdown ult, she has recently sprung up as the premier Sentinel Agent in the game. When we took on systemic damage and health interactions in Patch 5.12, we decided not to reduce Killjoy’s Turret health given her place in the ecosystem at the time. Given her place today, we are making the changes below.
We feel the duration of Boom Bot has led to a larger recon footprint than we felt was healthy, in regards to the ability’s secondary output. We are decreasing the amount of space the ability can cover in order to sharpen Boom Bot as a tool Raze and her team can use to follow up around angles."

New Act, new patch. We’ve got a lot in store starting with 6.08: Bind is back in Unrated and Competitive modes but Icebox is out, we’ve also made improvements to Gekko’s audio and updated Killjoy’s abilities. Also, there’s a Shorty cosmetics update for certain skinlines including the default Shorty.
As Killjoy has taken on a more prominent place in the meta, we’ve noticed a couple of areas where we could improve the ways her abilities interact with other players/the environment. We’ve done a pass on some of her audio cues to make them more distinct and make it clearer when her utility has been destroyed. In addition, we’ve increased the reveal radius on Nanoswarm (C) to better match its area of damage and make it more realistic for enemies that are moving methodically to track them down. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this balance point moving forward. Finally, we’ve removed the yellow warning indicator that was added to Lockdown (X) last patch, as it was too noisy on screen for the full duration of her ultimate winding up.
We have upgraded several Shorty models, including the default Shorty, to get them up to par visually with the rest of our weapons. These are just art updates—there will be no gameplay changes."

VALORANT Patch Notes 6.11,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-6-11/,2023-06-06T13:00:00.000Z,6.11,"Hey, everyone! It’s Jo-Ellen here.
Our Agents and Weapons teams have been hard at work on some minor and major changes for a few of your favorite Agents and weapons including Chamber, Viper, the Shorty, and the Frenzy. We’ve also made a few updates to Pearl’s B Site.
As always, let us know what you think about all the updates in Patch 6.11. Have fun!
Chamber has taken a backseat in overall pick-rate after the last round of changes in Patch 5.12. At the time, we reduced Chamber’s sphere of influence significantly. We’re looking to put more power into his ability to lurk, and give him more flexibility within his setups.
The Viper change below is meant to both create more explicit downtimes when playing around her utility, and address the multiplicative effects of Viper and Harbor’s vision block.
We want to ensure Viper and Harbor can be competitive independently, while also allowing room for teams to explore strategies that can counter them. This change retains Viper’s power moments while her utility is active, but asks you to be more precise on when to use it—giving attackers more agency and value in baiting out her fuel, and defenders a larger window to play around it during retakes. It also creates some moments of downtime when Harbor and Viper cycle their walls.
As always, we’ll be watching how these changes play out in the coming months and evaluating if any further updates are needed.
We've felt that Pearl's B Site has been problematic due to how difficult the site is to hold as a defender in conjunction with the amount of strong post-plant options available to attackers. With that in mind, we wanted to get a smaller scale update out before Champions to address those concerns.
We’ve adjusted the weapon spread on ropes across most weapons to make combat efficacy while on ropes a touch more difficult. This should allow combat on ropes to be viable in close range scenarios—which we feel is important to make them a viable map traversal tool—but much less often will it be a good choice in medium to long range engagements.
We like that the Shorty has found a viable role in the game though it has proven to be too reliable and accessible. We’re increasing the price to make purchasing the Shorty a more thoughtful decision throughout the course of the game while the damage adjustments require more accuracy to get one shot kills against fully armored opponents.
The Frenzy has been more potent at long ranges than we’d like. The spread (error) and recoil changes will make long range fights tougher while retaining much of the Frenzy’s short range power.
Error Power (also known as Center Biasing for us) is a tool we utilize to reward accuracy by biasing shots toward the center of the crosshair.
While this system is functioning as intended for stationary firing, it’s been unintentionally aiding firing while on the move. We’ve significantly reduced center biasing in these movement states: shots fired while moving are now almost uniformly random within their spread cone, meaning that fewer of these shots will precisely land on target.
Even so, Run-and-gun (and jump shooting) kills will still happen—and we think these kills are healthy in close range contexts with the right weapons—but this error power adjustment should help to reduce their frequency a moderate amount, particularly at longer ranges.
For a handful of weapons, we’ve increased vertical recoil while firing on the run. This makes the weapons feel less controllable in this state, and should reduce the number of incidental run-and-gun kills.
We wanted to inject more decision making when wall penning common spots or blind firing through smokes with the Phantom and Vandal. We’ll keep a close eye on the adjusted ammo reserves for these guns to make sure these weapons are still able to deal with shootables like Sage’s Barrier Orb (C) and Harbor’s Cove (Q)."

You've made it to Episode 7, Act 2—welcome.
With every new Act comes a good number of updates, changes, and additions. Say hello to Sunset, our newest map set in Riot’s hometown. Also in this patch is a bunch of Agent updates as well as the implementation of the changes to Breeze that we gave you a preview to a couple of weeks ago.
We always welcome your feedback so please let us know what you think. Thank you!
VALORANT asks you to make tough decisions when interacting with enemy utility—shooting, dodging, and timing your moment to take a decisive action. We want everyone to come away from rounds feeling like they had the possibility of making a better play if only they were a little faster or smarter. The team has noticed that when faced with multiple pieces of utility or some of larger scale ultimates, your avenues for counterplay can sometimes be overloaded, leading you to feel unsure of what's happening or what you could do differently next time.
While Patch 7.04 includes changes to over half of the roster, the changes are sharply focused on increasing game state clarity by making the following adjustments:
Reducing the frequency of large area of effect of ultimates
Reducing the amount of time utility is active in the world
Reducing the HP of shootable utility
We also believe the Ultimate cost updates below better align large area, high-impact ults with the pressure they place on the enemy, creating both a better pacing of the round-defining abilities and a clearer choice competition between high and low cost ults.
Though many of these changes are subtle, We hope all together they improve gamestate clarity and the sense that you have even more opportunities for your skill to shine through.
Aftershock (C)
Ticks reduced from 3 to 2
Damage increased from 60 per tick to 80
Rolling Thunder (X)
Ultimate points increased 8>>>9
Orbital Strike (X)
Ultimate points increased 7>>>8
Prowler (C)
Time to re-equip gun takes slightly longer after using the ability
Mosh Pit (C)
The impacted area does 10 damage per second before exploding
Wingman (Q)
HP reduced 100>>>80

Thrash’s explosion had a little makeover to make it easier to see and understand the area it has affected (on top of being beautiful)
Lockdown (X)
Ultimate points increased 8>>>9
Paranoia (Q)
No movement velocity imparted when casting
Skye has become a keystone of the current meta through her blend of recon and space taking utility. While we like that she can potentially unlock new comps through this combo, we think she has lacked clear weaknesses compared to her peers given the wide range of value she brings. These changes reduce the distance in which Guiding Light can provide info. Changes also helps reduce the amount of time enemies need to worry about her flash when she flies it a great distance without activating it. We’ve also reduced the health of Trailblazer and Seekers to make them slightly easier for enemies to deal with, Skye’s ultimate cost will increase to better reflect the high level of baseline value it provides.
We’ll be keeping a close eye on these updates to see if they push the choice competition between Skye and her peers into a healthy place, or if further updates are needed in either direction.
Guiding Light (E)
Max duration while casting reduced 2.5s >>>2s
Trailblazer (Q)
HP reduced 100>>>80
Seekers (X)
Ultimate Points increased 7 >>>8
Seeker Health decreased 150>>>120
Recon Bolt (E)
Total number of scans reduced 3>>>2
Viper’s Pit (X)
Ultimate points increased 8>>>9
We've noticed a large power disparity between Astra’s Gravity Well and Nova Pulse. Our goal is to create clearer use cases for both abilities: Gravity Well will be Astra’s tool for controlling space, and Nova Pulse for quickly affecting an area. At the same time, we hope to reduce some of the oppressive and long duration pressure Astra’s stars produce by providing enemies a chance to push past activated Gravity Well during its windup period if they act quickly.
We're updating Cosmic Divide to help clarify the overall game state by eliminating uncertainty around whether you or your enemies are close enough to the wall to be heard. We also think this gives Astra’s wall a clearer power profile for her and her allies to play around.
Gravity Well (C)
Startup time increased .6>>>1.25
Gravity time duration decreased 2.75>>>2.0
Nova Pulse (Q)
Startup time decreased from 1.25>>>1.0

Audio now is blocked completely by the wall rather than muffled
Since the last time we released changes to Jett, she has continued to be a mainstay of both competitive and professional play. We like that the dash changes in 4.08 pushed her to be more deliberate and tactical, but still feel that Jett is often given more reliable power windows and generous tuning than other Duelists and Agents in general.
Our goal with these changes is further sharpening Jett as the aggressive, high precision Duelist by increasing the intentionality of her ability usage and power windows. We want to maintain her unique ability to break through chokes and dash onto site, while reducing her defensive power-holding angles and her ability to reactively undo tactical mistakes with her array of quickly cast abilities.
We believe these changes align Jett’s overall power level and place in the Tactical Cycle with our other Agents, while maintaining Jett’s unique role and fantasy on the VALORANT roster. To help explain our thought process, we’ve provided context on how each change aims to support these goals, and we’ll be keeping a close eye on how these changes land at all levels of play.
Tailwind (E)
Dash window decreased 12s>>>7.5s.
At 12s, Jett could often find value activating her dash without clear intention or make incorrect calls but still have time to find another use for the dash. Shortening this window pushes Jett to be more deliberate with her calls and reduces Tailwind’s power at defensively holding angles, while minimally impacting her ability to proactively use the dash to break onto a site.
Activation windup increased 0.75s>>>1s.
Increasing Tailwind’s windup should promote proactive use by reducing Jett’s ability to activate it reactively when caught off guard or in the middle of a fight and successfully escape.
Cloudburst (C)
Duration decreased 4.5s>>>2.5s
Time to re-equip gun takes slightly longer after using the ability.
We want to reduce some of the persistent safety Jett gets dashing into or escaping with smokes, sharpening Cloudburst to be a fast but powerful tool that forces players to be quick and precise with their decisions.
Updraft (Q)
Charges decreased 2>>>1
With two Updrafts, we’ve seen moments where Jett escapes situations where they’ve been tactically outplayed by throwing enemies off by relying on Updraft’s unpredictable movement. We hope to reduce some of the unhealthy movement extremes Updraft can produce and increase the importance of using it at the right time.
Blade Storm (X)
Ultimate points increased 7>>>8.
Jett’s ultimate has proven one of the most flexible, reliable and economically powerful gun replacement Ultimates because of its lack of a timer, reset on kills, and harmony with Jett’s movement. This change should bring Blade Storm up to the same cost of comparable weapon ults, such as the Tour De Force and Showstopper.
Breeze will be rotating back into the Competitive and Unrated map pool.
Please note that Fracture and Pearl have been rotated out of the Competitive and Unrated map rotation.
Sunset, our newest map, features three lanes and two sites.
Please note that the Sunset Only queue will only be live for one week, and that all Sunset Only games will be in Swiftplay mode. Sunset will also be in the map rotation for Unrated. It then goes into the Competitive map rotation in Patch 7.05.
Breeze’s scale and size are core to the map’s design but we wanted to address rotation times by simplifying where threats could be to make retaking less dangerous. This set of changes aims to add more tradeoffs to A and B site slams that utilize post-plant utility to secure the round while adding more incentive for Attackers to control Mid to exert pressure throughout the map.
We closed off one side of Mid Pillar and tightened up Mid Cubby. As a result, Mid should be more comfortable to rotate through with more predictable threats.
Mid Pillar
Mid Cubby
We’ve adjusted B Site to make enemy positioning more predictable. This should make retake scenarios more manageable.
B Site
B Back
Halls required a lot of attention from Defenders often forcing them to spread thin. By blocking it off we hope this allows Defenders to better focus on where threats will come from while allowing both teams to invest more resources across the rest of the map.
A Hall
We expect there to be more fights in Mid and around Doors so we’ve adjusted this area to be more spacious and added a new stack of boxes as additional cover.
Mid Wood Doors
Cave added a lot of pressure to post plant situations and the split approach to A made it difficult for Defenders to confidently contest the space. These changes aim to make the main approach to A feel more neutral and less strong for post-plant.
A Cave
A Shop
We added a small platform at the bottom of each pyramid to make utility a bit easier to land around them. Also, we added signage to help differentiate callouts for the two pyramids.

ASTRA
Going in and out of Astral form is a complex mechanical task that leaves Astra vulnerable to attackers by denying her information about her surroundings.

And again, we’re always listening to your feedback so please send it our way!
After listening to your feedback, we have decided to remove the recent rank restriction made to 5 stacks that was implemented in Patch 7.06. We know how important it is to play with your friends and your need for flexibility in order to do that.
Initially, the rank restriction was made to prevent people from illegitimately boosting to the highest ranks like Radiant. In the end, we realized that your ability to have flexibility with your 5 stack was more important than the very small number of people who abuse this exploit. However, we still recognize that boosting is a risk to competitive integrity and are working on an appropriate long term solution that doesn't impact your ability to play with friends in a 5 stack.
In Patch 7.06, we fixed a bug that allowed the game to output surround sound when certain conditions were met, but the surround mix was untested and unsupported. VALORANT currently only supports stereo and mono sound output."

VALORANT Patch Notes 7.09,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-7-09/,2023-10-31T13:00:00.000Z,7.09,"What’s up? Jo-Ellen here.
Happy last Act of the year and cheers to Iso’s release! Get out there and try out our newest Duelist (let us know what you think) and don’t forget: there’s a rank reset, fresh Battlepass, and a new Premier Stage.
Aside from all the new things released at the beginning of a new Act, we also have some Agent updates below.
This patch, we’re looking to address some issues in the balance of power between Sentinels, especially Cypher, and some other Agents on the roster. Sentinels often craft very deliberate setups only to have Agents like Raze, Skye, and Fade destroy them with typical utility use. In this patch, we’re updating Cypher’s Trapwire (C) to try to sway these interactions more in his favor, and to encourage enemy Agents to have to be more intentional and deliberate if they aim to use their utility to counter Sentinel setups.
These changes force attackers to actively destroy traps to break Cypher’s setups and push interactions with utility like Prowlers (C) and Trailblazer (Q) more in Cypher’s favor. In addition, the potency of the traps when they snag an enemy has been increased slightly to make sure opponents have to respect their threat.
These changes to Skye and Fade are meant to add more strategic depth to the placement of Cypher’s Trapwire.
Raze will have to be more precise with her Paint Shells (E) in order to deal damage to enemies, including destroying enemy traps. Additionally, Raze will need to be more intentional in picking between using the Blast Pack (Q) for mobility or damage.
With the changes below, we’re sharpening the Judge’s identity as a hunker-down style shotgun by reducing some of its effectiveness while moving. With the reduced mag size, we’re hoping to create more opportunities for enemies to catch a person reloading their Judge as well as nudge the person with the Judge to be more efficient in order to get multi-kills.
Premier Stage E7A3 is live with a few updates and new features! As always, good luck in your games!

VALORANT Patch Notes 7.10,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-7-10/,2023-11-14T14:00:00.000Z,7.10,"Hey, everyone! Jo-Ellen here.
How are you liking Iso so far? Have you won all your 1v1s against him (or as him)? Below, we’ve got changes for Jett’s Blade Storm (X) and Deadlock’s GravNet (C) as well as Team Deathmatch only changes to Fade and Reyna. As always, let us know what you think. Enjoy!
GravNet (C) now requires anyone captured by it to manually remove the net in order to remove the effect. Before this, if you or the enemy were captured, you were able to remove it by moving out of the net radius or waiting for the effect to expire. We think this unlocks a unique power profile while making it a more interesting interaction on both sides, as enemies must put down their weapon and make a noise to deal with the debuff. In addition, we’ve made the ability more reliable for Deadlock to execute by increasing its radius while also ensuring that Agents like Jett and Raze can’t trivialize getting caught in it with their mobility."
VALORANT Patch Notes 7.12,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-7-12/,2023-12-05T14:00:00.000Z,7.12,"Howdy, all! Jo-Ellen here.
It’s the last patch for Episode 7 (and for 2023!). That means you’ve got a Battlepass to finish and some more ranks to climb before it all resets in the new year. But in the meantime, we’ve got Gekko and Skye updates, a new TDM map, and more below.
GEKKO
One of Gekko’s unique strengths is being able to reclaim his creatures. This change aims to make that process faster so you can reclaim them in more situations. In addition, we’re also increasing the reliability of Dizzy (E) to increase Gekko’s confidence when using the ability and to provide more incentive for him to engage with its reclaim.
SKYE
These changes are centered around pushing Skye to be more deliberate when using Trailblazer (Q):"
VALORANT Patch Notes 8.0,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-8-0/,2024-01-09T14:00:00.000Z,8.0,"Greetings, friends! Still Jo-Ellen here.
Welcome to Episode 8 Act I and Patch 8.0. There’s lots in store in just the first patch of 2024 (Hello? New weapon?) so have at it and have fun. As always, send us your feedback—we’re always listening.
The Outlaw goes live!
Deadlock
Continuing in the direction of the previous 7.10 GravNet (C) changes, we’re looking to build upon the unique strengths of Deadlock’s two other basic abilities: Sonic Sensor (Q) and Barrier Mesh (E).
Killjoy
The amount of coverage on Killjoy’s Turret (E) outshines other defensive recon tools when paired with the Turret’s other strengths, such as its autonomous detection and long range vision. Reducing its vision cone should push Killjoy to make clearer choices about what area of the map her Turret will cover, while the Turret’s updated visuals should aid you in quickly understanding what areas it will protect.
Doors Refactor
ICEBOX
Icebox is back with a few changes to shake up Mid, B Green and B Orange. Our goal with these changes is to add value and impact to Mid for either team controlling it and simplify pathing toward B Site through B Orange and B Green to make fights more predictable.
Attacker Side Spawn
B Green
B Tube Exterior
B Tube Interior
B Snow Pile
LOTUS
Attackers have felt fairly overwhelming to Defenders on Lotus. Because of this, we’re adding more options by adjusting neutral spaces and making some quality of life updates across the map so that Defenders can better hold sites.
A Main
A Link
A Hut
B Site
C Site

Rotating Doors
B Orb
Team Deathmatch
We felt that the Sheriff is overperforming in the Stage 2 weapon ecosystem and, as a result, other loadouts have been pushed to the side. This change aims to allow other weapons to be more viable when in an engagement against a Sheriff.
Map Rotation
Starting in Patch 8.0, VALORANT will support third party spatialization software for headphones.
Spatial Audio is virtual surround sound for headphones . This software processes sound to help you differentiate sounds that are in front, behind, or even above you, while listening on headphones. For example, figuring out if those footsteps were in front of you or behind you. We are excited to announce that Patch 8.0 will include official support for 3rd party spatial audio solutions! This gives you choices beyond the HRTF option which was already available in VALORANT’s audio settings. In Patch 7.06, we made changes to the audio engine that caused issues for those of you who were already using third party spatialization software, which we did not support at the time. When 3rd party spatialization software was active in Windows settings in 7.06, sound levels went haywire and our only solution at the time was to guide those being affected to turn third party spatialization software off for the time being. We implemented a stereo-only fix in 7.07 that was compatible with Spatial Audio, but did not allow it to virtualize surround sound. In Patch 8.0, the Speaker Configuration in VALORANT’s audio settings will default to stereo, but you can enjoy all of the features that these spatial audio solutions provide if you choose to opt in by setting the Speaker Configuration to Auto-Detect.
How can I experience Spatial Audio in VALORANT?
How can I turn off 3rd party spatialization?
Note: Some peripherals are bundled with their hardware manufacturer’s spatialization software. It is possible to have this software activate spatial audio on your PC in a way that is not visible in the Sound control panel in Windows, only in the software itself.
I already had 3rd party spatial audio software active, but in 8.0, gameplay sounds bad. How do I fix this?
What about Virtual 7.1 USB headphones?
I set VALORANT’s Speaker Configuration to Auto-Detect, but I didn’t activate Spatial Audio in my Windows settings. I’m listening to the game on USB headphones and now I don’t hear my own Agent’s VO or certain sounds that are emitting from directly in front of me or behind me. How can I fix this?
I like the HRTF that was in the game before, can I still use it?
What if I had HRTF enabled before, but I want to switch to trying another spatial audio software?
I use Bluetooth headphones. When I turn spatialization software on, the audio glitches repeatedly. How can I fix this?
What if I’m listening on speakers?
Is mono still supported as an accessibility feature?
I tried a 3rd party spatialization software format and it made me feel dizzy or nauseous. What’s up with that?
Does Spatial Audio affect competitive integrity?

VALORANT Patch Notes 8.01,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-8-01/,2024-01-23T14:00:00.000Z,8.01,"Hey, friends! Jo-Ellen here.
January 2024 is almost over, but we’ve still got one more patch before we say goodbye to the first month of the new year. Below, you’ll see some Agent updates as well as one update to Breeze. Keep reading and I’ll see you all back in A Hall.
One last note: we’re always listening to your feedback so please let us know what you think.
BREEZE
In the latter half of 2023, Skye became an increasingly dominant force within the Initiator role and began to clearly overshadow her peers in pick rate both in solo queue and coordinated play. Her core ability, Guiding Light (E), has been a main factor in her prominence, as it offers strong combat advantage, valuable recon and provided Skye with the only recharging flash amongst the Initiators. While we like Skye’s position having a mix of flash and recon and the diversity that can be brought to team comps, she’s lacked clear downsides to balance out this broad power.
These changes are centered around pushing Skye to be more intentional with Guiding Light (E). They should create a clearer opportunity cost when taking Skye in comps while also maintaining her uniquely powerful combination of combat advantage and recon within the Initiator role. We hope this update will land Skye in a spot where she is still viable in solo queue and coordinated play, but give room for other flash Agents to thrive. We'll be sure to keep a close eye to see if further changes are needed.
In the 6.07 patch, we removed the yellow warning indicators that appeared for people who were being chased by a close Seeker (X). We’re adding the indicators back in to make interactions with Seekers (X) more clear in chaotic engagements.
We’re updating Iso to push the agency and combat advantage that you get from Double Tap (E).
We’ve reduced the cost of Contingency to better reflect the value we see it generating in game.
With her Blast Pack (Q), Raze is often able to traverse a vast amount of space and suddenly become a threat to enemies. This audio update is meant to make it clearer when Raze is potentially Blast Packing (Q) into your area, especially when a lot of other action is going on at the same time.
Projectile Jump Throw Normalization
We have implemented a feature to make jump throw lineup behavior more consistently reproducible. If you press the throw projectile input within 100 ms of jump start, the projectile will consistently have the same amount of velocity imparted from the thrower and as a result land consistently in the same location.
Most existing jump throw lineups should still behave as they have in the past while being more consistent in output. In some cases, some minor adjustments may need to be made.
HRTF
HRTF will now be enabled if ticked and using Stereo speaker configuration.

Is it really almost time to say goodbye to Episode 8? Not quite. We still have plenty in store for the last Act. Check out the Viper and Cypher updates below. Also, new Act, new Stage of Premier.
Chamber
Cypher
Since his updates in 7.09, we’ve been excited to see Cypher solidify a stronger spot on the Sentinel roster, but feel it’s pushed his stalling power further than we’d like for an Agent that specializes in global information. Additionally, we’ve seen play patterns around Spycam (E) that lack counterplay for the enemy team.
Viper
As you have continued to improve leveraging Viper’s strengths, she’s grown into a dominant meta force and constant presence in pro play. With this update, we hope to solidify clear weaknesses that Viper has compared to her peers while still maintaining her unique identity as a Controller / Sentinel hybrid. You should feel that Viper has to commit to her positions and manage shorter individual up times per smoke use with her unique ability to control her smoke over time.
We messaged this out on socials but want to call out again that in 7.09 we unintentionally shipped some number changes to Viper’s fuel. For full visibility, you’ll see three numbers in some of the changes listed below: First will be before 7.09, second after 7.09, and the final is the update for 8.08.
A new Stage of Premier starts! With this one, we’re adding promotion."

Major update for this patch: our Basic Training Event. Read more about it below.
If anyone in your match is actioned on, you'll receive a notice when they are penalized, even if you didn't report them yourself. Please note that we already have reporter feedback, but this just expands the scope of who receives messages.
Basic Training Event
We are releasing an update to our Welcome Contract for new players! The new structure includes clearer missions and milestones to help you navigate the New Player Experience with a bit more guidance before your Ranked climb.
The Basic Training Event will appear similar to other Events, allowing you to view your progress, understand your goals at each milestone, and complete them to earn rewards to jumpstart your VALORANT experience.
If you have previously completed the Welcome Contract, you will not see the Basic Training Event (don’t worry, you have already earned all the same rewards!).
If you are partially complete with the Welcome Contract, your previously earned rewards will be reflected in the Basic Training Event when it comes online, and you will be able to proceed through Basic Training, earning XP toward your Battlepass.
Agent
Fixed an issue where shots fired immediately after exiting Cypher’s Spycam (E) would bypass the weapon’s raise animation and not deal damage. The weapon raise animation is now played for its full duration.
Fixed issues where the timer for Clove’s Pick-Me-Up (C) could be restarted which would allow Clove to have more time than intended to activate the ability."
VALORANT Patch Notes 8.11,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-811,2024-06-11T13:00:00.000Z,8.11,"Hi friends! Alice here with Patch 8.11, and this one is a bigger one. We’ve got some updates to some Duelists, these are the same that we shared last week. We also have a new map rotation, and a new map, Abyss… just make sure to watch your step. Additionally this will be the first patch our new friends on console will get to enjoy, we have some new features for them, and are excited to welcome them into our community!
We can’t wait to see your clips on Abyss (please show us your creative ways of knocking someone off, we’ve been dying to see them since we started developing this map), and hear your overall feedback for this patch, so please send it our way. Good luck in your matches and enjoy Patch 8.11.
For some context, this update is aimed to allow other Duelists to compete with Agents like Jett and Raze that excel at taking space for their team through sheer speed and mobility. These changes provide more ability for Duelists to take space for their team, and to be the tip of the spear through their own unique play styles—whether it's stronger pure dueling ability like Iso, a mixture of speed and evasion in combat like Neon, or Reyna's blend of being able to recover and escape from combat.
Iso is receiving strictly buffs this patch because he’s underperforming across all skill brackets. Leaning into increasing Iso’s signature ability output is intended to make Iso more reliable at challenging contested spaces and winning opening duels by granting his shield immediately after channeling the ability. Iso’s buff will also remain active and orbs will still spawn should he lose his shield and secure a kill during Double Tap’s uptime. Shooting the orbs will refresh the duration of the buff and the shield.
Double Tap (E)
Iso now grants himself a shield upon finishing a 1 second animation during which he can’t use his gun.
This plays a shield forming sound at the end of the channel when the shield is activated.
Charges 2 >>> 1
Kill reset added to Double Tap (Iso gets a charge back if he gets 2 kills).
Iso now receives a Wall Penetration tag instead of a standard Heavy Penetration tag when the shield is broken. This means he’s slowed less upon his shield breaking.
Additionally, Iso now gets a damage indicator towards the direction of the enemy that broke the shield
Iso can now recast Double Tap while it’s active to refresh the duration of the shield.
This is relevant if he gets a refreshed charge of his Double Tap from getting 2 kills.
We want to sharpen Neon as an Agent who excels at taking mobile fights directly to her opponents by buffing the unique value she brings to the table. We’ve made her slide more effective at sliding directly into opponents by making it more combat-ready, and by removing all weapon movement error when sliding as well as a few other changes. The updates to her Fast Lane (C) are intended to make fights around her wall dropping feel more intuitive for Neon’s allies while reducing the visual noise it creates in game.
Sharpening her Relay Bolt (Q) to be a more premium and reliable one-charge ability is intended to allow Neon to have more success when she does decide to commit to a fight with her slide, as well as make some room for the second slide charge.
Fast Lane (C)
Fast Lane (C) dissipates from behind to minimize visual noise in combat space while giving cover for Neon.
Fast Lane’s (C) audio has been updated to travel with the fade out of the wall.
Wall Duration 6s >>> 4s
Wall Dissolve Duration 1s >>> 2s
High Gear (E)
Sprint
Neon no longer has her strafe speed reduced while sprinting.
Max Sprint Speed while moving sideways 6.73 meters/second >>> 9.11 meters/second
Time until Full Fuel Regen 60s >>> 20s
Slide
Slide charges 1 >>> 2
Neon now removes all weapon movement error when sliding.
This effectively means she’s more accurate while sliding.
Second Slide Cost: 150
Equips out of slide: Fast >>> Instant
Slide equip buffer >>> .2s (after sliding, there is .2 seconds before her gun comes out)
Relay Bolt (Q)
Charges 2 >>> 1
Windup delay 1.1s >>> .8s
Concuss Duration 3.0s >>> 3.5s
Reyna is receiving both buffs and nerfs this patch to reshape the power of her kit. The goal of the changes is to reduce the level of dominance she can achieve in Ranked, especially at low and mid ranks when outperforming her enemies, while pushing some of her value in coordinated settings:
Healing has proven very strong statistically in Ranked with higher impact at low and mid ranks. This change should reduce her ability to snowball round-over-round in these settings.
Removing the time restrictions on her Devour (Q) and Empress (X) should allow you more flexibility to play at your team’s pace and increase the baseline value of both in coordinated play where rounds play out slower.
Dismiss (E) has been re-tuned to provide a greater movement speed boost, but has a shorter duration. This should reward decisive and skillful Reyna players by unlocking faster and more powerful combat repositioning.
We’ll be tracking how these updates affect Reyna across all the different skill levels and settings of play.
Devour (Q)
Healing decreased 100 >>> 50
Full heal time reduced from 3s >>> 2s
Overheal of armor no longer decays after a timer.
Dismiss (E)
Top speed increased 9.1 meters/second >>> 12 meters/second
Total duration of Dismiss reduced from 2s >>> 1.5s
Empress (X)
Empress no longer has a timer and is permanent until Reyna is killed or the round ends.
As we’ve seen you get better and better at Raze’s satchel mobility, we’ve found that her total speed and movement potential can undermine the tactical loop. These changes are intended to allow you to more reasonably counterplay Raze, whether through your own utility or gunplay. While we still want to maintain the sandbox movement fantasy of Raze’s satchels, she should not be as surprising when not supported by allied utility.
Blast Pack (Q)
Raze’s satchels no longer explode for damage/knockback upon opponent destruction.
Raze’s horizontal velocity when satcheling has been slowed.
Satchel explosion audio has been updated to be audible farther away to ensure enemies can hear the first satchel when a Raze double satchels.
While we’re excited with how Clove has been immediately relevant in Ranked and how much you’re enjoying playing them, their performance in ranked play is stronger than we’d like. We’re trimming some extraneous power from their selfish, Duelist-oriented outputs while preserving the Controller-leaning power in their kit.
Pick-Me-Up (C)
Cost 100 >>> 200
Duration 10s >>> 8s
Damaging Assist Time to activate 10s >>> 6s
Not Dead Yet (X)
Cost 7 >>> 8
Unequip Delay .7 >>> .8s
BUG FIX: Clove’s ultimate will no longer survive the fighting state if they get a smoke assist.
We’ve also added a new VO line for Omen and for Clove when starting a match on Abyss.
PC
Esports Hub Team Page Improvements
We’ve added roles to our roster information to help differentiate between players, substitutes, and coaches.
We’ve added blurbs highlighting the personality and accomplishments for teams in VCT Americas and VCT Pacific, with more on the way!
Radio Command Wheels
With player-to-player communications being so vital to the core game loop of VALORANT, we’ve taken the opportunity to improve our Radio Command Wheels to include more relevant call-outs, a higher variety of pings and Agent VO, and brand new Wheels to extend player communication across more phases of the round. We’ve also removed some less useful commands to make the wheels as quick and easy to use as possible while making sure the most important commands are easy to access.
These changes add specificity & clarity to the existing communication tools and add new ways for teammates to strategize and communicate:
New Strategy Wheels during the Buy Phase
Unique Strategy Wheels for Attackers and Defenders
New Commands Wheel on the Megamap
Updated options on existing Command Wheels
Updated VO on existing Commands Menu (PC only)
Streamlined Wheels to feature our most important command options
New Player Tips
As you join our community and complete the tutorial and start sharpening your skills on the battlefield, we want to make sure you are armed with the right information to succeed and secure that clutch! So, we’ve implemented a ""New Player Tip"" system that will display useful in-game information based on the actions you take during the match. These tips will provide critical information for gameplay fundamentals, potential focuses for skill improvements, and suggestions for advanced strategies.
Our New Player Tips have been built from the ground up for Console Limited Beta to give you more opportunities to skill-up and learn VALORANT faster via:
Tips that 'listen' to your in-match actions and behaviors
Tips that level up with you as you learn the fundamentals of VALORANT gameplay, from beginner to advanced strategies
If you’re a returning player, New Player Tips won't show up, since you already have a good grasp of the fundamentals. If they do pop up, and you’d like them to stop, you can always switch them off in Settings
NEW MAP: ABYSS
A 5v5 spike mode map that provides thrilling danger with its precarious pitfalls (watch your step) and vertical gameplay. ABYSS is the first VALORANT map that has no boundaries and takes place in the secret hidden fortress of the Scions of the Hourglass.
Abyss is our newest map and features three lanes and two sites.
MAP POOL UPDATES
Please note, there are significant map pool updates in the 8.11 patch. In addition to a brand new map entering the rotation, we have made the following changes.

In Patch 8.11, we will be implementing an intermediate change to mitigate an exploit around remakes. Previously, matches that ended in a remake weren't being acted upon appropriately by our systems allowing players to attempt repeated remakes without seeing any enforcement. Now, we’ve increased the intervention severity for AFKs resulting in a remade match. This means players will immediately encounter an intervention in this scenario, which will increase through repeated occurrences. We're still exploring this space, so please keep providing us with your feedback.
We’ve updated the friends list to display VALORANT console players. This means any of your Riot friends who are playing on console will appear under “other games” in your friends list.
We’ve changed the default behavior of voice chat to prioritize team voice. Now when you connect to a team voice channel, you will automatically be speaking to your whole team, not just party members.
After playoffs on June 23, teams that performed well enough will get promotion notifications!
If you’re in Open - Elite Divisions, win your playoff bracket and you’ll see a notification when you return to the Premier hub.
If you’re in the Contender Division, finish in the top 32 teams and you’ll see a notification the first time you visit the Premier hub after the standings finalization time.
If you’re on a team that earned a promotion, your division icon on the Premier hub and Premier Team page will have a promotion indicator for the rest of Stage E8A3.
If you’re in Open - Elite Divisions, you’ll be placed at least one division higher at the start of Stage E9A1.
If you’re in the Contender Division, you’ll be placed into the new Invite Division, where you’ll compete for an opportunity to make it into a Challengers League.
The Store has had a visual update to increase clarity and quality of the buy phase experience.
Ally utility is now visible on team member slots for easier strategization.
Remaining armor is now visualized as a fill in the UI.
Holistically added animations to increase clarity around affordability, requesting and weapon purchases.
Item states have gone through a visual pass to improve readability.

VALORANT Patch Notes 9.0,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-0,2024-06-25T13:00:00.000Z,9.0,"Hey, friends. Jo-Ellen, here.
Say hello to Episode 9 and its very first patch. There's a lot.
You'll see an update to Iso's Double Tap as well as Abyss entering Ranked on PC.
We've added new conversation voice lines between Agents that includes: Phoenix, Harbor, Brimstone, Yoru, Raze, Iso, Sage, Neon, Gekko, Skye, Deadlock, Omen, Kayo, and Reyna.
Iso
We're happy that Iso has been more comfortable entry-ing towards the front of his team but want to increase thoughtfulness and context around when Iso activates his Double Tap . This should make the counterplay around breaking his shield or denying the Double Tap orbs more successful.
So we're decreasing the duration of his Double Tap buff while also removing the refresh that comes with securing two kills. Iso can now only extend Double Tap by shooting the orbs that spawn while the buff is active.
Double Tap (E) : Duration: 20s >>> 12s
Signature kill reset removed
Sova's Owl Drone's HP is now 100, up from 60.
Abyss added to the Ranked map pool.
Competitive Mode is coming to Console this patch! Queue up and see if you can climb the ranks and make it onto the Immortal Leaderboards. Good luck on your first race to Radiant!
Our Competitive Mode map pool will start with Abyss, Ascent, Bind, Haven, and Sunset with new maps slowly being added in the next few patches.
Added a new ""Controls Preset"" selection screen upon first boot-up prior to loading into the tutorial
You can now choose between our VALORANT-specific controls preset or a more familiar, TRADITIONAL console FPS preset as your starting controls scheme.
You can easily change your preset and customize controls at any point once in-game through the Settings menu.
Polished sound transitions between Focus and ADS to better reflect the aim state you're transitioning into.
Crosshair presets have been updated to reflect a better variety of usable crosshairs.
Updated the Fighter controls preset so that Crouch is a Hold action instead of a Toggle action.
Added holistic Aim Sensitivity slider.
Added the ability to enter precision mode while in controls settings to adjust sensitivity sliders by .1 increments.
In addition to removing zero tolerance terms from text chat, people who repeatedly engage in this behavior will see increased penalties on their transgressions.
Welcome to the Path to Pro!
Teams in Contender that earned a promotion in Stage E8A3 are in the new Invite Division, where finishing the Stage at a high enough rank will earn you an opportunity to make it into a Challengers League.
Contender and Invite Divisions play a little differently:
Strict rematch protection in weekly matches prevents you from ever matching against the same team more than once in a Stage.
If we can't find you an appropriate match during the queue window, you'll be given a Bye. Byes award a match win and 100 points.
Losses award 0 points.
Finals in playoffs are Best of 3 matchups.
There are some extra roster restrictions for Contender and Invite Division teams.
For all the details on new rules in Contender and Invite, check out our updated Everything You Need to Know About Premier article .
When you add a friend, you can now paste or type a full Riot ID (including tagline) into the ""Riot ID"" field and it will automatically split the data into the ""Riot ID"" and ""tagline"" fields.
We've updated the communications menu so it's easier to manage team and party voice on the fly.
We've added Voice Chat to the Settings page. Now you can tailor your mic behavior and voice settings to suit your setup.

The standings page sometimes fails to update, and you may see fewer teams than expected. Click on another tab in the Premier Hub and then return to standings to fix the issue.
If you are in Contender or Invite and are awarded a Bye during Weekly matches, you will not see that match recorded in their Premier Match History tab. You will be awarded a win and 100 Premier Score as expected, and that is reflected correctly on the standings."
VALORANT Patch Notes 9.03,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-03,2024-08-13T13:00:00.000Z,9.03,"Hey folks! I’m Ash and I’m a new Community Manager on the team. Don’t worry, Jo-Ellen is still here – I’ll be helping her out with patch notes from now on so you’ll see me from time to time. I’m excited to start sharing game updates with y’all so let’s get right to it with Patch Notes 9.03.
We’ve made improvements to ground spreading abilities and added a preview to Sage’s Barrier Orb so the placement preview now also shows up on the minimap. Additionally, Pearl is entering Unrated and Swift Play queues on Console.
Hope everyone has been enjoying VALORANT on Console so far!
Made improvements to how overlapping interactable objects work. You should now perform the desired action more consistently.
For Example: A dart from Cypher’s Spycam should no longer prevent you from attaching to a rope if you’re directly looking at it.
Ground Spreading Abilities
We're making improvements to abilities that spread along the ground like Brimstone’s Incendiary and Viper's Snakebite . Previously, these abilities had inconsistent effects depending on the exact location they landed, ranging from extremely different sizes or damaging through walls and in areas the ability wasn’t visually present. With this update, these abilities should spread more consistently and only apply damage in places that are consistent with the visuals.
Map Targeted Abilities Improvements
You can now ping and see additional icons on maps used for ability targeting
Affected abilities: Brimstone’s Sky Smoke and Orbital Strike , Clove’s Ruse , and Omen’s From The Shadows

Improved the performance of Iso’s Kill Contract ability.
General

Fixed a bug where pinging guns on the ground was not displaying the gun's name in the text feed.
Fixed a rare bug that resulted in the defuse timer showing up as ‘-00.00’ if the Spike was defused as the round timer hit 0.

General
Fixed issue where opening an Ability map and the Shop/Scoreboard simultaneously could result in a loss of input.
Fixed an issue where pressing an Ability button while defusing the Spike would equip a weapon.

We’re adding a new Agent to our roster, Vyse. She’s a Sentinel with a unique kit that will surely make you hesitate before stomping onto a site. I recommend heading to the Range to work on your pistol game since you’ll be using it more when going against her!
Additionally, Split is entering Unrated and Swift Play queues on Console, and we’ve fixed quite a few bugs. Let us know what you think about the update and we’ll see you on the battlefield!
The Unlimited Abilities cheat will now add 100% fuel and remove any fuel consumption from Neon's High Gear , Skye's Regrowth , and Viper's Toxic Screen and Poison Cloud
Vyse goes live!
Vyse will be released to regions in a staggered rollout starting from 8/28 at 1 PM PT .
Abilities:
Arc Rose: EQUIP an Arc Rose. Target a surface and FIRE to place a stealthed Arc Rose, or ALT Fire to place the Arc Rose through it. REUSE to blind all players looking at it. This ability can be picked up to be REDEPLOYED.
Shear: EQUIP filaments of liquid metal. FIRE to place a hidden wall trap. When an enemy crosses, an indestructible wall bursts from the ground behind them. The wall lasts for a brief time before dissipating.
Razorvine: EQUIP a nest of liquid metal. FIRE to launch. Upon landing, the nest becomes invisible. When ACTIVATED, it sprawls out into a large razorvine nest which slows and damages all players who move through it.
Steel Garden: EQUIP a bramble of liquid metal. FIRE to send the metal erupting from you as a torrent of metal thorns, JAMMING enemy primary weapons after a brief windup.
Watch our newest Sentinel disarm her enemies below.
We will be issuing a behavioral manual evaluation to players who have a pattern of engaging in comms abuse in order to create a healthier comms experience in VALORANT.

VALORANT Patch Notes 9.08,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-08,2024-10-22T13:00:00.000Z,9.08,"Welcome to the start of Episode 9 Act III. Let’s get into it.
The previously announced Sunset changes are now playable. Also playable is our newest Team Deathmatch map called “Glitch.”
Other updates in this patch include: a map rotation change, Yoru’s Fakeout now interacting differently with certain Agent abilities, updates to Gekko’s abilities aka globules aka radivores aka Gekko’s besties, and more.
Gekko
As you have mastered Gekko’s utility since his last buff in patch 7.12 , we’ve noticed that his core play pattern of using and reclaiming his buddies has little to no downside. These changes to his globules put pressure on Gekko to more quickly reclaim them, and also allow for more counterplay for Gekko’s opponents to punish him if he’s too reckless.
Dizzy and Wingman are each getting improvements to their overall reliability to reduce cases where you hear or see them target and debuff an enemy, only to find that enemy is unaffected. These changes are targeted at addressing inconsistent behavior rather than a direct power increase for Gekko.
Dizzy is in a healthy state in terms of how often you successfully engage in its shooting counterplay, but we feel that Dizzy holds space and angles for too long. Additionally, given Gekko’s overall number of plants and defuses with Wingman , Thrash is available too frequently for its impact.
We hope these changes don’t wildly affect Gekko’s place in the ecosystem, but instead put him in a healthier long term place.
Yoru
Various abilities were not showing effects on Yoru’s Fakeout clone, which made it too easy to discern it from the real Yoru. We are going through abilities in the game and making sure they interact properly with Yoru’s Fakeout.
Skye and Jett
Introducing “Glitch”, VALORANT’s Newest Team Deathmatch Map
Map Rotations
Sunset
We’re updating Sunset’s B Site to address defensibility, post plant, and provide more ways to play on site. The B Main pivot box was adding a ton of pressure during post plant so we’ve opted to simplify the cover here. You can still play B Main during post plant, but it should now be easier to manage for retakers. A particular Cypher trip has also been removed with these changes.

We fixed various bugs with Agents, such as Deadlock’s ANNIHILATION sometimes getting stuck at ledges, players being able to outrun Fade’s Prowler, and now Gekko’s Thrash won’t have as much difficulty making some small jumps.
There’s more to come with these year-end patches so stay tuned!
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed a bug where the locking in animation in the Agent Select would not play immediately when instalocking.
Fixed a bug where you would see a blank screen as a tournament coach during Agent Select.
Agent
Fixed a bug where Yoru would hold the Nocturnum scythe incorrectly after using Dimensional Drift.
Fixed a bug where Gekko’s Thrash had difficulty making some small jumps. Thrash should now jump more similarly to a player.
Fixed a bug where players pulled by Deadlock’s ANNIHILATION would sometimes get stuck at the top of ledges.
Fixed a bug where players could outrun Fade’s Prowler during its Bite. Prowlers should now continue to track its target during the Bite unless the target teleports outside its line of sight.
Fixed a bug where Astra would not receive the alert sound effect when being watched by Cypher’s Spycam.
Fixed a bug where Killjoy’s Turret would not display the deactivation range on the minimap after switching between her Turret and other abilities or weapons.
Fixed a bug where KAY/O with NULL/cmd active could be picked up by Yoru during Dimensional Drift.
Maps
Abyss
Fixed a bug that allowed the breakable doors in mid to be destroyed when shot from a certain angle.
PREMIER UPDATES
Updated dropdowns on the standings tab to include Invite division in the division list for all zones. Selecting an Invite division to view will change your zone dropdown to the appropriate zone.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed an issue where you could load into Agent Select early by leaving your party as the “Match Found” popup appeared.
Removed an exploit that resulted in a stretched FOV, when using windowed-mode at a 4:3 resolution.
Premier
Fixed an issue where the Competitor Crest title was not displayed on the Premier career page after earning that Crest.
GENERAL UPDATES

VALORANT Patch Notes 9.10,https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-10,2024-11-19T14:00:00.000Z,9.10,"Morning, gamers. It’s Ash. Let’s talk about Patch 9.10.
Continuing the spirit of year-end patches, we took a closer look at Controllers, Sentinels, and our boy Phoenix. There are quite a few changes to our gameplay systems and armory, including a rework to how the Combat Report works, adding the new Regen Shield, and tuning adjustments to weapons that will surely change the tides of future pistol rounds. Let’s just say, I’ll be buying Frenzy more often.
Buckle up, this one’s hot.
NEW ARMOR
Regen Shield
We want to expand the strategic and tactical possibilities within the VALORANT competitive sandbox by introducing a new defensive option. Regen Shield has been added to the shop.
Cost: 650 Credits
Damage Absorption: 25 HP
Regeneration Pool: 50 HP
Absorbs 100% of incoming damage taken before damage to health occurs.
After a brief delay, the shield regenerates by draining any remaining points left in the Regeneration Pool.
AGENT UPDATES
Cypher
Cypher has been a dominant force with his map-wide information gathering and powerful kill setups. Because Cypher’s map-wide info is intended to be his unique strength, we want to target the efficacy of his kill potential.
We’re adjusting the Trap Wire to increase the counterplay time window after hitting it, so that there is more of a balance between a well-crafted setup and enemies deliberately trying to break trap wires. Additionally, this will help team compositions who don’t have as much utility to deal with unbreakable traps.
Cypher’s ultimate has been extra powerful after adding the second reveal and the removal of time restriction on enemy corpses in patch 5.10, so we’re bumping up the cost to put it more in-line with other comparable ultimates.
Trap Wire :
Now has a .5 second windup before the full wallhack reveal applies and fades in.
Trap wire now has updated minimap icon treatment to better display what the trap wire is connected to.
Neural Theft :
Ult Cost 6 >>> 7
Sage
Sage has been feeling weak with relatively low pick rate in high-level play. We want to continue to hone in her ability to stall and slow down attackers when pushing into areas her team controls.
With the added dash speed reduction on Slowing Orb, well-timed, proactive casts of her Slowing Orb should feel rewarding and make slows a more meaningful debuff against duelists with dashes.
Healing Orb : Self Heal 30HP >>> 50HP
Heal time matched to ally heal at around 5 seconds
Slowing Orb : Now will additionally reduce the dash speed of enemies caught inside the slowing zone by 50% similar to the Concuss changes in the Gameplay Systems Updates later in the patch notes.
Resurrection : Ult Cost 8 >>> 7
Deadlock
Deadlock’s ultimate will now always kill the target when the timer expires and they are not freed from the nanowire cocoon. Previously, captured targets only died if they reached the end location before the timer expired.
Deadlock’s visuals for health on the Annihilation Cocoon and Barrier Mesh have been updated to make their health states more clear.
Omen
Omen has been a mainstay controller in high-level play for a long time. He particularly shines in his ability to create ambiguity throughout a round with the low cooldowns on his smokes. However, Omen’s ability to place one-way smokes inside level geometry provides significant defensive power with low counterplay. We’ll be keeping an eye out here for how these changes affect the overall controller ecosystem.
Dark Cover :
Dark Cover will now always fall to level geometry similar to other spherical smokes like Brimstone’s Sky Smoke, Clove’s Ruse, etc.
This should prevent Omen from placing one-way smokes on small ornamental pieces of Geometry, like the fuse boxes in the main of Split B and only allow him to place smokes where players can stand.
Clove
Ruse :
Ally vs enemy clarity around Ruse casts for both alive and dead casts of smokes have been improved.
Enemy smokes updated to appear more red than ally smokes
Not Dead Yet :
Time to get a kill: 12s >>> 10s
This change had been made accidentally in Patch 8.11 when fixing another bug, but the ultimate has been performing well at this tuning.
Phoenix
Following up from our updates to Duelist in 8.11, we’re taking an opportunity to let Phoenix shine brighter as the bold and confident duelist he is. His updates encourage him to get back to the fight quickly, break into sites with his Curve Ball and reward him for succeeding on entry.
Phoenix now applies a Heal over time to himself whenever he touches his flames which persists even if he leaves the fire. This allows him to dip into his flames and then continue to press the offense.
Curve Ball :
Changed to the signature ability slot
Grants a free charge on round start
2 kill reset to generate an additional charge
Hot Hands :
Changed to a non-signature ability
Cost 200 credits
Blaze :
We want to support Phoenix’s hybrid “jack of all trades” utility value by allowing him to cast Blaze from safety for his teammates similar to other vision-blocking utility.
Initial projectile goes through walls, allowing Blaze to function similarly to Harbor’s High Tide.
Jett
Drift (Passive)
Balance-impacting bug fix: Jett can no longer float while suppressed or detained.
MAP UPDATES
Sunset
We updated global lighting for the entire map. Players should see an improvement in lighting quality and general visibility in previously darker portions of the map.
GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES
The changes to the gameplay systems in this patch are to better support VALORANT’s tactical gameplay. The combat report is intended to share in-game information easily. We’re always paying attention to how these systems are playing out, including ways that those systems can be used to create advantages that are counter to their intended use cases.
Combat Report
While the combat report should be a tool to provide gameplay context for what your impact was within a round of VALORANT, it has the occasional downside of leaking information to you that you otherwise would have had no way of knowing.
This happens most often with utility, such as Breach’s Flashpoint or Skye’s Guiding Light: You use your utility and get killed, but inadvertently also discover you blinded players you never saw or engaged with.
With these kinds of cases in mind, we’re making a change to the Combat Report:
Your utility usage statistics now appear once the round has resolved rather than immediately upon death.
In its place, you will see an animated hourglass. Once the round ends, utility usage statistics will become available and persist through pre-round of the next round.
Concusses
Well-placed concusses should be just as consequential for our movement-oriented Duelists as other agents.
We also think this strengthens defensive teleports compared to dashes as more flexible repositioning options to compensate for their weakness in entry capabilities.
Concusses now slow enemy dashes by 50%
This affects Jett’s Tailwind and Neon’s Slide.
Overheal UI Visual Update
We’ve updated the way we show overheal shields in the bottom HUD to improve legibility.
This affects how we show bonus HP after using Reyna’s Devour and Clove’s Pick-Me-Up.
Smoke Visual Update
Visual cues have been added to the inside of the smoke to let you know when they are about to disappear to better support decision making. These cues match up with the ones that exist on the outside of the smoke.
The following Agents’ smokes have been affected:
Astra
Brimstone
Omen
Clove
WEAPONS UPDATES
We’re making some tuning adjustments to weapons.
As VALORANT has grown and evolved, you all have learned how to take advantage of different methods of swinging and peeking. Because of the way bullet tagging in VALORANT works (slowing down when shots land on you), shot players are often tagged and then slowed down into the walking state and as a result their weapons become quickly more accurate.
We want to maintain this intuitive relationship between player movement speed and accuracy, so we’re opting to increase all moving state accuracy penalties (AKA “movement error”) and encourage intentionality in movement when shooting.
The Sheriff and the Frenzy already have different movement error inaccuracies compared to the other pistols, which are valuable to maintain for the sake of their identities.
SMGs are unaffected, as we believe that their mobile accuracy is a core part of how the weapons are unique within the arsenal.
The Ghost having more bullets than the Frenzy didn’t make intuitive sense given their unique strength and weakness profiles amongst the pistols.
Pistol Inaccuracy Changes
All Pistols (except the shorty)
Moving while crouching Inaccuracy: .1 >>> .5
Classic
Right Click Running Inaccuracy: 1.3 >>> 1.5
Right Click Burst Jumping Inaccuracy: 2.1 >>> 2.25
Walking Inaccuracy: 0.84 >>> 1.1
Run Inaccuracy: 2 >>> 2.3
Ghost
Walking Inaccuracy: 0.84 >>> 1.1
Run Inaccuracy: 2 >>> 2.3
Rifles
All Rifles
Walk Inaccuracy: 2 >>> 3
Run Inaccuracy: 5 >> 6
Machine Guns
All Machine Guns
Walk Inaccuracy: 2.4 >>> 3
Run Inaccuracy: 6 >>> 6.5
Pistol Bullet Count Changes
Frenzy
Bullet Count Increased 13 >>> 15
Ghost
Bullet Count Reduced 15 >>> 13
There have been fewer Phantom purchases over time with new maps being released and higher proficiency in shooting. The Phantom and Vandal’s current differences are intended to keep their identities unique while still being relatively competitive with each other. These changes are intended to make the Phantom feel better to use primarily and reduce frustrating instances of headshots doing less damage than expected at different distances. These breakpoints will remove some instances of 140 headshots and all instances of 124 in 1 headshots (excluding wall penetration).
Phantom
Damage fall-off changed:
Previously:
39 damage per bullet (0 - 15m)
35 damage per bullet (15 - 30m)
31 damage per bullet (30m+)
Now:
39 damage per bullet (0 - 20m)
35 damage per bullet (20m+)

Premier
Hey IBIT zone Premier Players!
There was an issue with matchmaking that prevented matches from being played in the first 2 weeks of the Episode 9 Act 1 stage. Contender and Invite divisions were unaffected and these teams successfully played their matches.
Issue has been fixed and teams should be able to find matches successfully for week 3 and on.
Any team that plays a match in the IBIT zone in week 6 and before will automatically qualify for playoffs.
Teams that have already played a match in another EU zone can still earn the playoff qualification in IBIT, but will require teams to create a new roster in the IBIT zone and play a match.
Teams will qualify for playoffs by receiving 600 points before the start of week 7 matches.
For example, if your team has 25 points at the end of week 6, then your team will have 625 points before you play your week 7 matches.
It is now possible to freely rebind non-ultimate Ability Button mappings.
Added settings for inverting map cursor controls.

Added voice indicators to the Party tab in the social panel, so you can see who is speaking.
Added a button to leave the party to the My Party section of the Party tab in the social panel.
